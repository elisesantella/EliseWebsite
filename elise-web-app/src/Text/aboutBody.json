    "aboutText": "Born & raised in WA, Australia, I decided to make the rather small jump across the pond to the Emerald Isle also known as Ireland.\nFrom the halls of Atlantic Technological University, I graduated with first class honours in Bachelor of Engineering in Software Development & Electronic Engineering.\nI was fortunate to kickstart my software career at Jaguar Land Rover driving cars & sometimes working on code. \nI now currently work for a start-up straight out of Portugal, working on comparing energy deals for consumers across Europe (Pretty cool).\nIn my spare time, when Iâ€™m not daydreaming about a beach somewhere, I freelance in website and app creation."
